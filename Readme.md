# Mobile Flash Card Project
This is an app build for the <b>Udacity React</b> course and with this I will demostrate what I've learned during that course.

<b>Mobile Flash Card</b> is a mobile App build with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/expo/create-react-native-app),
that allow users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create differen categories of flashcards called <b><i>decks</i></b>,
add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.
